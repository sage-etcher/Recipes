[Name] LibXpresent
[Summary] libXpresent provides an X Window System client interface to the Present extension to the X protocol.
[Description] The Present extension provides a way for applications to update their window contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion, synchronizing with the display refresh and potentially using a more efficient mechanism than copying the contents of the source pixmap.

This package contains the development headers for the library found in libxpresent1. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
